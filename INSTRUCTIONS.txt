MTG COMBO FINDER - STANDALONE VERSION
======================================

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Cannot run by just opening index.html! ⚠️

QUICK START (REQUIRED):
----------------------
Double-click "EASY_START.bat" to launch the app!

This starts a local web server and opens the app.
KEEP THE BLACK WINDOW OPEN while using the app.

Requirements: Node.js OR Python (free downloads)
- Node.js: https://nodejs.org
- Python: https://python.org


WHY DO I NEED A SERVER?
-----------------------
The Commander Spellbook API blocks requests from file:// URLs
due to CORS (browser security). A local server solves this.


ALTERNATIVE METHODS:
-------------------
1. Navigate to the "dist" folder
2. Double-click "index.html" to open in your browser
3. If white screen, use the server method above


BROWSER COMPATIBILITY:
---------------------
Works best with:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari

Note: Some older browsers may not support all features.


FEATURES:
---------
✓ Search 68,000+ combos from Commander Spellbook
✓ Filter by color identity and format
✓ Hover over card names to preview them
✓ Click combos for detailed breakdowns
✓ View card images and popularity


OFFLINE MODE:
------------
The app requires an internet connection to:
- Load combo data from Commander Spellbook API
- Display card images from Scryfall

The app files themselves work offline, but you need internet
to fetch the actual combo database.


TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
If the app doesn't open:
1. Make sure you have an internet connection
2. Try opening "dist/index.html" manually
3. Allow JavaScript in your browser settings
4. Check if your antivirus is blocking the files


UPDATING:
--------
To get the latest version:
1. Delete the "dist" folder
2. Run: npm run build
3. The new standalone version will be in the "dist" folder
